## The strengths and weaknesses of the different research methods and techniques --

This study was conducted using a lab experiment design. This is good because it makes it easy to replicate by other researchers, this is because of the standardized procedure that is used. They also allow for precise control of extraneous and independent variables. This allows a cause and effect relationship to be established.
On the other hand, the artificiality of the setting may produce unnatural behaviour that does not reflect real life, i.e. low ecological validity. This means it would not be possible to generalize the findings to a real life setting. Demand characteristics and experimenter effect also may bias the results.

In study one and study two a repeated measures design is used. As the same participants are used in each condition, participant variables, such as individual differences, are reduced. also fewer people are needed as they take part in all conditions, which saves time.
Although the repeated measures design has drawbacks, there may be order effects, which means the order of the conditions may have an effect on the participants' behaviour. This limitation, however, can be controlled usin counterbalancing. To combat oder effects the reaseracher counter balances the order of the conditions for the participants. Alternating the order in which participants perform in different conditions of and experiment.

In study three an independant measures design was used. This means more people were needed than with the other two experiments. This does however avoid order effects as people participate in only one. If a person is involved in several conditions, they may become bored, tired, and fed up by the time they come to the second condition or they may figure out the requirements of the experiment. On the other hand, differences between participants in the groups may affect results, for example; variations in age, gender, or social background. These differences are known as participant variables.

## Strengths and weaknesses of different types of data --

Quantitive data was gathered in all experiments. This allows for larger sample sizes, which means the experimenter can conduct a robust analysis of the results. Quantitative data is also impartial due to its absoluteness. Data is also anonymous which means that participants don't have to worry about being identified due to sensitive data.
On the other hand, quantitive data doesnt allow for follow up on any answers given which means that if data needs more explanation, another study is needed. quantitive data also doesnt explain _how_ something happened, it can only explain _what_ happened.

## Ethical considerations --

Students and research workers knew they were taking part in a study and they completed practice trials so they knew what to expect (Informed consent).
However, in experiment two, participants were told the aim was to make as few errors as possible in the shadowing task but the real aim was to test if an affevtive cue would penetrate the block. This is deception and it breaks the principle of integrity.

## Internal validity --

High controlled design increases internal validity as a cause and effect relationship can be easily established

## Ecological validity --

completing a shadowed task is not a familiar task to participants so the results are hard to generalise, this means the study had  low ecological validity.

## Reliability --

The procedures of the study, including instructions given to participants, are highly standardised whivh allows the study to easily replicated and to check for the reliability of the findings.

## Sampling bias --

University students took part (as well as research workers). This sample is easily accessible, so it saves time and money usually used on obtaining participants. However, the sample is not representative of the wider populations, as students and research workers are likely to have higher cognitive abilities and may perform better on attention tasks. Therefore the study lacks population validity.

## Ethnocentrism

This study only had participants from one culture and from a similar age group. This makes it quite ethnocentric as it is possible that people from other cultures may not focus their attention in the same way.
However, since the cognitive area relies on the physicology of our brains and it says that behaviour is not related to culture, we can argue that this study is not ethnocentric.
