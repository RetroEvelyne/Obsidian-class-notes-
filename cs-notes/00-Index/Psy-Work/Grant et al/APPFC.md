## Aim --
To show that environmental context can have a more positive effect on performance in a memory test when the test takes place in the same environment that the material was studied in compared to having a different environment.

## Participants --
Eight members of a psychology laboratory class each recruited five people that they know to serve as participants. There were 40 people, aged 17-56, (17 Males, 23 Females). One person's results were omitted from the analyses.

## Procedure --
- Informed consent was read aloud.
- Participants were asked to read the given article once, they were allowed to highlight as they read.
- Participants were informed that their comprehension would be tested with both a short-answer test and a multiple-choice test.
- All participants wore headphones regardless of condition. People in the noisy condition were told they would hear moderately loud background noise and that they should ignore it.
- Reading times were recorded by experimenters
- A 2 minute break before the test phase was taken.
- The short-answer test was given, followed by the multiple-choice test.
- Participants were tested in either noisy or silent conditions and they were informed of the condition before being tested, again everyone wore headphones.
- All participants were debriefed after the test phase.
- The entire process took around 30 minutes.
