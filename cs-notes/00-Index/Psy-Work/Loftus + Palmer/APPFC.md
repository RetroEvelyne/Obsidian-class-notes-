## Aim --

To investigate the influence of leading questions on the accuracy of EWT, memory recall

## Participants --

Expt1 => 45 People
Expt2 => 150 People

## Procedure --

Expt1 => People were presented with seven video clips of car crashes followed by a series of Short Answer Questions (SAQ's). The critical question "How fast were the cars going when they (hit, smashed, collided, contacted) eachother?"
Expt2 => The verbs hit and smashed llwk later people were asked if they had seen broken glass.

## Findings --

Expt1 => The results show that thew word used in the question did, on average, alter the estimate of speed. e.g. "Smashed" produced a higher estimate than "Contacted".
Expt2 => The word "Smashed" increased both the estimate of speed and the likelihood of reporting seeing broken glass that wasnt present.

## Conclusion --

Expt1 =>
	1. Individuals were poor at estimating speed
	2. Individuals were systematically and significantly influenced by the wording of a question.
- This may be due to a genuine distortion of the participants memory due to the influence of the verb,
- Or the eddect of response bias factors. The participants may be unsure and just adjust their estimates to fit the expectations.
Expt2 => 
Two types of information make up the memory of a complext event:
	> The information obtained from the perception of the event
	> Other information obtained after the event
According to Loftus:
	"Over time, the information from these two sources may be integrated in such a way that we are unable to tell from which source some specific detail is recalled. All we have is one memory."
