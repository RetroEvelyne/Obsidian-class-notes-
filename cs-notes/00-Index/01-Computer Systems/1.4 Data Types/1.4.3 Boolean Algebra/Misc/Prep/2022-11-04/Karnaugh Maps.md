__Boolean expressions__ represent electrical circuits in computer systems and selection statements in programming.
- We can use __logic gates__ to illustrate these circuits.
It is important to use as few expressions as possible to make the circuits as efficient as possible and therefore make the computer more efficient.

- A __Karnaugh map__ can be used to model expressions
	- They can give more information than a __truth table__
	- You can solve __Boolean expressions__ by making groups on the __Karnaugh map__
